## Abstract Summary
The dataset corresponds to research analyzing the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) through optogenetic fMRI in hemi-parkinsonian rats. It explores the underlying neural mechanisms and therapeutic potential of subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. The study provides insights into the neural targets and circuitry impacted by DBS, offering a nuanced understanding of its efficacy in managing motor symptoms in PD.

## Dataset Description
This dataset includes fMRI images, optogenetic stimulation parameters, and behavioral analysis results from hemi-parkinsonian rats subjected to subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation. It is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard, facilitating easy use and interpretation.
